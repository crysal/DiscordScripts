# DiscordScripts
Where I put all the script I made for automating some tasks in discord

## discordBioUpdater.sh

a script to update your "About Me" to something gotten from a file (in this case The Bee Movie script)

#### To get mfa/authorization token

  1. open discord (either the app or in a browser)
  2. open the inspect tool (in app "Ctrl + shift + i", in browser "f12")
  3. select the network tab
  4. go into your settings on discord, a bunch of sites should appear in the network tab
  5. look for a line with the name "science" or "https://discord.com/api/v9/science".. click it
  6. in the "headers" tab, scroll down and look for "authorization" under the "Request Headers"
  7. copy that into where you need it
